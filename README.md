# MetalWoz
Discord bot to parse Total Annihilation-style .fbi and .tdf unit/weapons files and allow users to search for unit info.

Files located in units and unitinfo are taken directly from the game Metal Factions. Find the latest version of Metal Factions files at the repository located at https://github.com/springraaar/metal_factions.

To use, edit metal.js to include your discord bot token. Run with `node metal`.
